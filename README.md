### Getting started with Practice

Go Methods are functions with a special _receiver_ argument.

```go
func (receiver Type) MethodName(parameterList) (returnTypes) {
}
```

Notice the way we called the method IsAbove() on the Point instance p.  Itâ€™s exactly like the way you call methods in an object-oriented programming language.
